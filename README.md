A Duolingo-inspired habit tracker for Ramadan. Check off daily deeds, keep your streak, and track your progress through the month.

---

## What it does

Ramadan Quest gives you 12 daily deeds grouped into four pillars — prayer, iman, fasting, and social good — and turns them into a simple check-in you can complete in under a minute. The app resets daily, tracks streaks, and shows a friendly leaderboard to keep you motivated without adding pressure.

The 12-deed structure is a deliberate design choice: three deeds per pillar, balanced and sustainable, loosely mirroring the 12 months of the Islamic calendar. Enough to feel meaningful, not enough to feel like a chore.

## Adapting it for your country

The app is mobile-first and designed to work for any region and timezone. See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) for instructions on swapping in your own regions, timezone, and database defaults.
