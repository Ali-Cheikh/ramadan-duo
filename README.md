# Ramadan Quest

Ramadan Quest is a mobile-first habit tracker designed to help users build consistent, meaningful spiritual routines during Ramadan. It turns daily practices into a calm, simple rhythm: complete your deeds, keep your streak, and reflect on progress.

## What It Is

Ramadan Quest focuses on 12 daily deeds grouped into four pillars: prayer, iman, fasting habits, and social good. The app emphasizes steadiness over intensity. The design is intentionally small and focused so users can complete their check-in in under a minute.

## Why 12 Deeds

The number 12 is used as a symbolic structure and a practical limit.

- **Symbolic:** The Islamic calendar is made of 12 months, and Ramadan is one of them. The app reflects that monthly rhythm with a daily set of 12.
- **Balanced:** 12 deeds split into four pillars creates a balanced daily checklist (3 per pillar).
- **Sustainable:** 12 is enough to feel meaningful without being overwhelming.

This is not a theological claim about a sacred number. It is a design choice that aligns with the monthly rhythm of the Islamic calendar and keeps the experience focused.

## How It Works

- **Daily Deeds:** Each day resets at a fixed local time so users can track consistently.
- **Streaks:** The app rewards consistency, not perfection.
- **Leaderboards:** Friendly rankings help motivate users while keeping the focus on growth.
- **Mobile-Only:** The experience is built for phones, where daily habits live.
